## Eisenhower Matrix

This is a simple app that let's you create, edit and delete tasks in an Eisenhower matrix based on their importance and urgency. This helps with planning what to focus on.

### Getting Started
- This was built on replit, so there's a whole bunch of replit config in it
- fork it onto a replit
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the [configuration file](#.replit). Here are the vite docs for [serving production websites](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html)

### Typescript

Just rename any file from `.jsx` to `.tsx`. You can also try our [TypeScript Template](https://replit.com/@replit/React-TypeScript)
